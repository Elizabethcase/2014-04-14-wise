Your track will meet in 50A-5132 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
To get to the lab, please take the [Blue Uphill shuttle][shuttle] from Berkeley. 
You may see a special shuttle which is reserved just for this bootcamp. If you 
see one, get on it.

use the shuttle, stop at the B65 stop. Cross the street and take the wooden 
stairs up to the top. Make a left. Go through the double glass doors and go to 
the end of the hall. Take the elevators to the 5th floor. Make a left as soon as 
you exit the elevators. 50A-5132 will be the first door on the left.
