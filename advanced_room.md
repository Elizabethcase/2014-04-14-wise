Your track will meet in 50A-5132 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
To get to the lab, please take the [Blue Uphill shuttle][shuttle] from Berkeley. 
You may see a special shuttle which is reserved just for this bootcamp. If you 
see one, get on it. Here is the [schedule for the special 
shuttle](img/location/shuttle.png).

50A-5132 stands for building 50A, room 5132. If you use the shuttle, stop at the 
B65 stop. Cross the street and take the wooden stairs up to the top. Make a 
left. Go through the double glass doors and go to the end of the hall. Take the 
elevators to the 5th floor. Make a left as soon as you exit the elevators. 
50A-5132 will be the first door on the left.
