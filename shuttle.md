title: Special Shuttle Schedule for WiSE
---


To handle overflow, there will be a special shuttle running from downtown
Berkeley to the Laboratory, just to the rooms where the bootcamp will be
happening. The schedule for that shuttle includes an evening drop off at
Alumni Hall for the reception as well.

Note that the **pick-up** location is near the downtown Berkeley BART stop, in 
front of a store called Scandinavian  Designs.
