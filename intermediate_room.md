Your track will meet in 15-253 at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. 
To get to the lab, please take the [Blue Uphill shuttle][shuttle] from Berkeley.
You may see a special shuttle which is reserved just for this bootcamp. If you 
see one, get on it. Here is the [schedule for the special 
shuttle](img/location/shuttle.png).

15-253 stands for building 15, room 253. If you use the shuttle, stop at the 
Cafeteria stop. Walk up the hill toward the Guest House. Continue toward 
building 15, which will be on your left.

For more details, you can find building 15 on this [Interactive Map][map].
